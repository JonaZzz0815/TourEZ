**TourEasy: Simplifying Travel Itinerary Planning**

Planning a travel itinerary has traditionally been a daunting task for many travelers. From poring over numerous travel guides and scouring through various travel communities for tips, to toggling between different websites for flights, hotels, and maps, the process can quickly become overwhelming. This exhausting experience inspired TourEasy, a web application designed to make travel planning effortless and enjoyable. By simply entering their travel preferences, such as modes of transportation, attractions, and accommodations, users can rely on TourEasy to connect the dots and deliver the best possible route. Our system also highlights the most recommended attractions for the entered destination, ensuring travelers have the best experience and donâ€™t miss any must-visit sites.


## Overview

Once users start by selecting their departure city, destination, and travel days, the application introduces a user-friendly interface. A sidebar tab for each day of the trip allows users to add resorts they wish to visit, order these resorts, and then the application generates the shortest route connecting the departure point, destination, and all selected resorts for the day.

For an enhanced planning experience, another sidebar recommends the most popular resorts and restaurants of the place, enabling users to easily choose and plan their activities. If users prefer not to spend time planning routes and resorts manually, the application can auto-generate a route for the day for user reference.

After the trip planning is complete, the application offers a feature to export the itinerary. This export includes all information about flights, stays, and resorts, which is especially useful for visa applications or as a backup. This suite of features makes TourEasy a comprehensive tool for making travel planning effortless and enjoyable. A more comprehensive explanation of each feature is detailed below.

### Component architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture using React. It consists of multiple pages and components that interact with each other to provide a comprehensive travel recommendation system. The main components and pages are organized into separate folders based on their functionality. The application communicates with a backend server using Axios to fetch data from various endpoints. The backend server is assumed to be running on http://localhost:8050 and provides APIs for retrieving states, cities, attractions, businesses, flights, and hotels.The main entry point of the application is index.js, which renders the App component. The App component sets up the routing using React Router and renders the appropriate components based on the current route.Pages and Features:
